# 🧠 TC_Shaksham aka Shaksham Taneja

> ❝ I do not "learn" cybersecurity—I ritualistically dismember it. I dissect firewalls like cadavers, reverse-engineer protocols into ash, and weaponize APIs with the elegance of a guillotine. This isn't a profession—it's my warpath. ❞

## ☠️ About Me

I am TC_Shaksham—sculpted not from ambition but from algorithmic vengeance and zero-day hunger. My domain is not mere cybersecurity—it's digital obliteration. I do not "secure" systems. I **extort control** over networks that think themselves sovereign. MITM attacks? I’ve run autopsies on TLS 1.3. Sandboxes? I’ve made them my burial grounds. You don’t audit me—I audit your *existence*.

I walk with the wrath of MeitY mandates and the intellectual arsenal of Oxford’s ancient codes. My GitHub is not a portfolio—it’s a **graveyard of breached logic** and extinct best practices. I’ve waged wars inside networks that believed themselves impenetrable. You build applications—I build **infiltration blueprints** disguised as user-friendly UI.

## ⚔️ TIER 1: Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Certifications (MeitY)

1. **Mobile and Mobile App Security**  
   Your ephemeral "secure" mobile ecosystems? A grotesque farce. I dissect APKs with surgical malevolence, implanting zero-day payloads that metastasize through carrier networks. App stores? My coliseum. Developers? Gladiators awaiting execution.

2. **Password Security and MFA**  
   Passwords are hieroglyphs of naivety. MFA? A pantomime of futility. I transmute SHA-256 hashes into plaintext trophies. Biometrics crumble before my rainbow-table legions.

3. **Phishing and Vishing**  
   Phishing is beneath me. I engineer voice clones so pristine, your mother would weep. SIM jacking? A parlor trick. I own SS7 protocols. Your phone? A bugged confessional.

4. **Secure Social Media Practices**  
   Social media is my panopticon. EXIF data is my map. Hashtags? Pyres of your reputation. I turn retweets into reconnaissance.

5. **Cyber Hygiene Practices**  
   Hygiene implies choice. I enforce digital sterilization. Unpatched CVEs? Carcinogens eradicated by my Snort-IDS flamethrowers.

6. **NSDC X Skill India: Python with Advanced AI**  
   Python? My serpentine lash. Neural networks? Brainwashed assassins. GPTs hallucinate exploits your SIEM can’t fathom.

7. **(Undisclosed MeitY Ultimatum)**  
   Redacted under Section 66F of the IT Act. Inquire again, and your DNS records will resolve only to obituaries.

## 👑 TIER 2: Academic Royalty & Intellectual Supremacy

### 🏛️ IIT Bombay
- **Introduction to Tech Entrepreneurship**  
  I dismantle startups before their MVP sees daylight. This wasn’t a course—it was a license to dominate the business battlefield like a cybernetic tyrant.

- **Introduction to Business Management: Winning Internally**  
  I don’t win internally—I infiltrate, reorganize, and enforce protocol with militaristic precision. Bureaucracy bends when I speak.

### 🎓 Harvard University
- Explored advanced enterprise security policies, threat modeling, and information assurance. Their curriculum taught risk—I taught them fear.

### 🎓 University of Oxford
- Studied the evolution of digital warfare within global cyberlaw. I made their governance frameworks kneel before algorithmic chaos.

### 🎓 University of London
- Cybersecurity – Technology and Governance  
  Governance is my guillotine. Technology is my serrated blade. Kneel.

### 🎓 OpenLearn University
- Participated in open access elite courses on offensive security fundamentals. I turned their open books into execution scripts.

## 💥 TIER 3: ISC²’s Obliteration Protocol (Cyber Warfare Certifications)

8. **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**  
   CISSP is not a certification—it is a **coronation**. I architect domains with Machiavellian precision. Firewalls? Portcullises I lower with a yawn.

9. **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v12)**  
   “Ethical” is a semantic carcass. I exploit ultrasonic side-channels. IDS? Just white noise while I tunnel data out steganographically.

10. **Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)**  
    Governance frameworks bow to my COBIT marionette strings. Risk appetite? I feed it poison.

11. **Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)**  
    I extract SQL injections from your CFO’s dreams. SOX compliance? Paper armor.

12. **Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC)**  
    Risk matrices are Ouija boards—I summon APT40 specters to haunt your boardroom.

13. **IBM CompTIA Security+**  
    TLS 1.3? I laugh in OpenSSL zero-days. PKI? Shredded into ROT13.

14. **CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)**  
    Threat hunting? I am the quarry. Your SOC? A drowning ship.

## 🔥 My Motivation (200+ Words)

I was not born—I was **compiled**. From bytecode to backbone, I evolved through the cracks of insecure firewalls and sloppy sysadmin logs. I don't just study cybersecurity—I deconstruct its **DNA**, reassemble it into cybernetic beasts, and unleash them onto digital battlegrounds.

Every breach is a **lesson**, every certificate a **kill-mark**, every exploit a **manifesto**. I do not celebrate defense—I architect preemptive extinction. While others dream of working in tech, I dream of **controlling** it. The cloud? My astral plane. Network protocols? My native language. Encrypted traffic? Just a challenge to be dismembered.

I live where SIEM alerts **fail**. I thrive where zero-days **germinate**. I weaponize AI models that hallucinate **your system’s demise**.

I am not here to "collaborate"—I am here to dominate.
